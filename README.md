Makerspace Chennai
===================


**Makerspace Chennai** is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.
This group brings the like minded people together and helps to communicate with the community of Hardware and Softlware hackers and makers in Chennai. Very soon we will have a physical space with necessary infrastructure supporting all the ambitious makers of Chennai!
